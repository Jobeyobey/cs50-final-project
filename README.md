# To do

## The idea
Create a board-game collection app, where you can:
- Look up games
    - Search query returns a list of board games with ID's
    - View a page with that game

- Add games to your collection
    - Look up game
    - Button to add games to your collection

- Log plays
    - Date, players
    - Scoreboard
    - Game duration
    - Notes
    - Player stats

- Add friends and see their collections
    - Search other users
    - Add users


- Check the 'hot' games right now
- Rate your collection
- Look for games you would like based on another game

### TODO
- Home Page (Hot games, your collection, friends, friend recent games, menu bar at bottom/top)
    - Only one query at a time?
- Search page
    - Boardgame page
- Profile Page
    - Friends Page
    - Collection Page

#### BGG API
I've got the BGG API working on my computer, however for more flexibility I should look into webscraping

## The idea

Create an app to keep track of your boardgame collection. Also you can keep track of games played, as well as see your friends' collections!

### TODO
- Refine Everything
    - Playlog should have most recent game at top
    - User is currently never auto-logged-out
    - Styling
        - Index page tiles
        - 'Cancel Request' on friend page border
        - Playlog overlay
        - Replace or adapt dice logo: http://127.0.0.1:5000/gamepage?id=339705
        - Other
    - 'Loading' not always appearing on search

- Allow import of collection from BGG
